### **About**
12 years of software development (9 years in iOS).

I worked on numerous iOS projects, some successful (thousands and millions of users), some not so much. 

- Love good architecture and clear naming of things
- I prefer to not create complexity when it's not needed (but do it when it is)
- Like new technologies but prefer to wait when they become stable
- Can propose new features/solutions for business, estimate and write docs for them, implement, test and deploy
- Could lead a small team of developers (gathering information, preparing tasks, code review)
- Love automation (could it be CI/CD, or local scripts or code generation) when it saves time/resources
